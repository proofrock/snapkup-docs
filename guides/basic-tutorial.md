# ðŸ”¢ Basic tutorial

In this tutorial, we will back up the contents of the `/home/my/MyImportantDir`, using the `/home/my/MySnapkupDir` folder as the container of the backup structures.

{% hint style="info" %}
All the commands have shortcuts; e.g. `root add` can be `r a`. Read the help! (`snapkup --help`)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
UNIX-style command is used (`snapkup`); of course, under windows you will use `snapkup.exe`
{% endhint %}

### Specify the encryption password

Everything is encrypted in snapkup, so you have to specify the password. There are three ways to do so: via an environment variable; via a credentials file in the filesystem; or via prompt in the application.

**From env var**

The encryption password can be read from an environment variable, `SNAPKUP_PASSWORD`, so you can use:

```
// UNIX
export SNAPKUP_PASSWORD=MyCoolPwd

// Windows CMD (batch files)
set "SNAPKUP_PASSWORD=MyCoolPwd"

// Windows Powershell
$env:SNAPKUP_PASSWORD = 'MyCoolPwd'
```

**From credentials file**

You can create a `.snapkup-creds` file in your home dir, and assign a password to a profile:

```
myProfile:MyCoolPwd
```

Then start snapkup specifying the profile:

```
snapkup --profile myProfile ...
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Under UNIX, the file must be user-readable only (i.e. permissions `0600` or `-rw-------`).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Under Windows, there's no reliable way to enforce this, so use this method at your own risk!
{% endhint %}

It can contain as many profiles as you like, for usage for different "instances" of snapkup. The profile is the part of each row up until the first `:` and the password is the rest of the row. Rows that start with `#` or are empty are treated as comments.

**From prompt**

If the password is not provided with the methods above, it will be prompted for, unless the `--no-pwd-prompt` flag is specified. For batch operations, consider to always specify this flag.

### Initialize the backup directory

You need to initialize a directory to store the backups to. It's specified with the `--backup-dir` (or `-d`) flag, and this flag will need to be repeated for every command.

```
snapkup -d /home/my/MySnapkupDir init
```

It requires an empty directory and creates a shallow dir structure to organize the files, along with a `snapkup.dat` file (encrypted) that will store all the metadata. Also, generates the encryption and checksum keys.

### Register the directory(es) to back up as a root

Now we need to register one or more directories or files to actually backup. The command is:

```
snapkup -d /home/my/MySnapkupDir root add /home/my/MyImportantDir
```

All its contents will be recursively scanned when performing a snapshot (see below).

{% hint style="info" %}
The absolute path will be stored, to avoid ambiguities.
{% endhint %}

As many roots as you want can be stored; `root list` and `root del` commands are available to manage the list of roots.

### Take your first snapshot

As simple as:

```
snapkup -d /home/my/MySnapkupDir snap do -l "My first snapshot"
```

It walks the roots' filesystem trees, and hashes every file. It then compares the hashes with the files already stored, and stores only those files that are not already been backed up in the past.

`-l` specifies a label for this snap, and can be omitted.

All (unique) files are stored as data "blobs", that are compressed (unless `--no-compress` is specified), encrypted and protected with a checksum.

Metadata (path, mod time, access mode) of files and folders are preserved for each snapshot.

A numeric snap ID is returned, and it can be used for a variety of operations: `snap label`, `snap list`, `snap filelist`, `snap info` and of course `snap del`.

Removing a snapshot with `snap del` will remove all the orphaned blobs, freeing disk space.

### Reduce the number of files

When having a multitude of small files is not desirable, e.g. in a remote sync scenario, it's possible to merge files in an "agglo". You can specify the threshold size of the files to merge and the target size of the agglo, in megabytes.

`agglo calc` allows you to evaluate the number of files that will be merged, and the result.

```
snapkup -d /home/my/MySnapkupDir agglo calc 1 5
```

This will preview what would happen if you merged all the files up to 1Mb in agglos that are (approximately) 5Mb. Use `agglo do` with the same parameters to actually perform the merge:

```
snapkup -d /home/my/MySnapkupDir agglo do 1 5
```

Doing the opposite is of course possible, i.e. unpacking all the agglos in small files, and removing the agglos:

```
snapkup -d /home/my/MySnapkupDir agglo unpack
```

{% hint style="info" %}
When deleting a snapshot that references a blob inside an agglo, the agglo is not modified even if it's the last reference (in the online sync scenario we mentioned, for example, it would trigger a new sync). To reclaim the space, `agglo unpack` the agglos and the dangling files will not be restored; then `agglo do` again.
{% endhint %}

### Restore it!

To restore all the roots e.g. for snapshot `0`:

```
snapkup -d /home/my/MySnapkupDir snap restore 0 /home/my/MyRestoreDir
```

The destination directory must be empty.

It is also possible to specify a prefix path to select only a part of the file list:

```
snapkup -d /home/my/MySnapkupDir snap restore 0 /home/my/MyRestoreDir --prefix-path /foo/bar
```
